How to update the Swagger-generated API to contact the controller

1. You need to get the API specification. Long-term you should be able to get from the server,
but for now go to the internal repository and find the checked in SwaggerClient.yaml there.

2. Copy the content from there, and add into https://editor.swagger.io/
3. Choose Generate Client, and choose Typescript-Node as the client to generate
4. This will download a zip file. Open it and copy contents of api.ts
5. Copy this content to apiGenerated.ts
- keep the copyright header and everything above the let defaultBasePath = xyz line,
- Override the rest of the file
6. Format the apiGenerated.ts file so it passes gulp hygiene
